# Autonomous Waste Sorting Bin

## Overview

An intelligent system that automatically sorts waste items (such as plastic, metal, paper, biodegradable, etc.), using computer vision and machine learning. The project is implemented using Python, with a web interface (or dashboard) for monitoring and control.

Typical workflow:

1. Camera captures image of waste item.
2. Image is processed via machine learning model(s) to classify the type of waste.
3. An actuator / mechanism directs the item into the correct bin.
4. System dashboard shows real-time status, statistics, logs.
